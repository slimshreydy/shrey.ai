Hey, I'm Shrey, and I'm a software engineer based in the Bay.  I'm utterly fascinated by [language](https://xkcd.com/1576/), [information](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fix-disinformation-facts), and the [future](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/may/intelligent-tutors.html) of [education](https://www.brookings.edu/research/beyond-reopening-schools-how-education-can-emerge-stronger-than-before-covid-19/).

Originally from the dusty deserts of AZ, I sought out non-cactus flora and moved to CA, where I saw trees for the first time and [even became one myself](https://www.quora.com/What-do-Stanford-students-call-themselves).

Now, I do ML and MLOps at [Primer](https://primer.ai/), where I'm scaling our ML systems and building the world's first comprehensive AI-powered [stack for countering disinformation](https://primer.ai/blog/developing-the-first-ai-platform-to-detect-and-assess-disinformation/).

I try to live life by taking integrity seriously and not taking myself too seriously.

# What I've done before

In the past, I've

- studied computer science at Stanford and have 2 (absurdly expensive) pieces of 65lb ivory parchment paper to prove it
- invested in the best student-run startups at [Dorm Room Fund](https://www.dormroomfund.com/)
- taught CS as a [CS198 Section Leader](https://cs198.stanford.edu/cs198/) and as a TA for courses in [programming language theory](https://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/) and [computer systems](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs110/cs110.1204/)
- run a practical [bootcamp on design thinking](https://ases.stanford.edu/)
- eaten the world's spiciest edible pepper in [sauce form](https://pepperpalace.com/products/the-end-hot-sauce)
- tried to convince myself I can [dance elegantly](https://youtu.be/7PS0ORAhMPU?t=453)
